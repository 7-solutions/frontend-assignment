Please make a todo list that
- Have a list of clickable buttons.
- Each button will be moved into its own column separated by type.
- Once moved, each button will have 5 seconds on the screen and then will be moved back to the bottom of the main list.
- If click on the right column (Fruit/Vegetable) the item must go back to the bottom of the left column (list) immediately.
